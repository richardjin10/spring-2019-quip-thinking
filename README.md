# Quip Thinking
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/quip-thinking.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/quip-thinking)

**Quip Thinking** is a game based off of the popular game called Quiplash, originally made by the developers at Jackbox Games.

The original game involves two people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on which answer they liked the most. Quip Thinking puts a new spin on the game to give users a fresh take.

We give users the ability to play with anyone, from their friends to strangers, from the comfort of their computers or phones. They can join a public room, or make their own private room with a room code to play with friends. Users can also add their own prompt (first vetted by our software, of course!) to our database of prompts.
